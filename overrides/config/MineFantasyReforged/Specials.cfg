"armour features" {
    # This feature Sets supported armours to calculate weapons differently: 
    # Damage is divided into cutting and blunt, and MF armours will alter their ratings depending 
    # Both weapons and ranged entities can be registered to deliver a certain ratio 
    # Armours can't be registered, all coding needs to be hardwired into the code themselves 
    # So this means mod armours can not support this, they need to have a system built-in to their own codingBut this ratio only effects armours that are told to. so it should have no effect on unsupported armours, being balanced as usual 
    # Undefined weapon damages however have no effect either, but it will try and guess 
    # This will also change change axes and blunt weapons to match blade damage (since armour is vulnerable to blunt
